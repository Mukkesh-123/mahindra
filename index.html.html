        <h1 id="heading2"><u>AUDI RS7 Sportback</u></h1>
        <p id="p1">The Audi RS7 is one of the fastest four-door sedans on the planet. It packs in almost 600bhp and offers enough performance to shame some lightweight sports cars. The striking design looks racy even at standstill and the exquisite interiors blend well with the car’s sporty demeanour. Though Quattro all-wheel-drive offers enough grip, the high kerb weight makes it feel heavy in corners.</p>

        <h1 id="heading3"><u>MAHINDRA XUV500</u></h1>
        <p id="p2">Mahindra introduced the XUV500 as its flagship over the Scorpio seven years back. It flaunted some segment-first features, car-like driving dynamics and could seat seven in a luxurious setting, that too at a price point where it actually felt, “value for money”. But while there were initial apprehensions among the buyers about spending more than Rs 12 lakh for the Mahindra badge, the XUV did brilliantly to subside them over time. Fast forward seven years and the Rs 10 lakh to Rs 20 lakh price bracket has gotten some serious competitors. That meant the XUV500 became just another face in the crowd.</p>
